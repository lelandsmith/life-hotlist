# Migration Plan: From Monolithic to Modular

## Why This Approach Will Work

1. **app-v2.html** starts fresh with ONLY the working authentication pattern from working-auth.html
2. Once auth is stable, we migrate features one at a time
3. Each feature becomes a module that loads AFTER authentication succeeds
4. No more race conditions or initialization conflicts

## Phase 1: Auth Foundation âœ“
- Created app-v2.html with clean auth (just completed)
- Test it at http://localhost:5173/app-v2.html

## Phase 2: Core Data (Next Steps)
Once auth works reliably, we'll create modules:

```javascript
// modules/contacts.js
export async function loadContacts(supabase, userId) {
  // All contact management code
}

// modules/companies.js
export async function loadCompanies(supabase, userId) {
  // All company management code
}

// modules/activities.js
export async function loadActivities(supabase, userId) {
  // All activity tracking code
}
```

## Phase 3: Gradual Migration
1. Test app-v2.html authentication
2. Copy working UI components from index.html
3. Move data operations into modules
4. Add features incrementally
5. Once complete, rename app-v2.html to index.html

## Benefits
- Authentication works immediately (proven pattern)
- No more 8000+ line file
- Each module can be debugged independently
- Clean separation of concerns
- Can deploy and test incrementally

## Testing Instructions
1. Open http://localhost:3000/app-v2.html
2. Try Google login - should work
3. Try magic link - should work
4. After login, you'll see basic data loading

This approach gives you a working app TODAY that we can enhance incrementally.
